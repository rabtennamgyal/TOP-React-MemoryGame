                There are 12 cards containing 12 different Football Clubs. The goal is to
                click on a different club on every turn. If you choose all the 
                different clubs in 12 turns, you win. If you clicked a club that 
                has been already clicked, you lose. The cards will be shuffled after
                every click.
